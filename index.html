                        <p class="about__text">I opened my eyes which had bonded together after a long sleep, I sat up right in the
                            middle of an inky dark chilly night, everything was tranquil and the moon’s white light
                            came through the firm glass of my windows and fell on my face. It gave me a relaxing
                            feeling, like I could touch and feel the light. I kept my leg on the glacial floor of my
                            room. I started walking and I could only hear the ticking of clock, like I could feel every
                            moment, every second pass. This was the first time I was feeling life, it was slow and
                            peaceful. My legs were paining a bit, it felt like I hadn’t walked in days though it had
                            just been a few hours. It’s like something was stopping me, I knew it was my cold soul,
                            but I could feel energy around me.I sat down on my bed wondering If I should get
                            something from the refrigerator, I was starving but too lethargic to get anything, it’s
                            like, my body sort of got heavy all of a sudden or I got too weak to handle it. In
                            seconds of me debating with myself I heard a voice, I couldn’t recognize what is was of,
                            but felt like footsteps on the stubborn ,freezing floor of the toxic winter. All of sudden I
                            remembered the news that came out last month about a dwelling spirit and a lot of
                            cases associated with it.For a moment I got a spine chill, I couldn’t feel the cold
                            atmosphere, I gulped, but it felt like there was a lump in my through that wouldn’t go
                            down. My fingers started to shake as my body shivered and my heart started thumping
                            loud like I could here it in this silent night. In the morning loud knock on the door
                            woke me up, I walked sluggishly to open it.Though I was still confused of what has
                            happened last night and how I suddenly slept, but avoiding these thoughts, I opened
                            the door to find Amy ,my friend who I have known my whole life. She walked in and
                            had a beam on her face, she was talking to me, but I had no idea what she was saying,
                            I just woke up and my head was still spinning and I was absolutely bewildered of what
                            in the world is going on. I went to the kitchen to get a cup of coffee so I am wide
                            awake for this really unpredictable day. Just when I came out of the kitchen taking a
                            sip of my really warm black coffee in this icy-cold morning, Amy said that she really
                            liked talking to my sister. I was absolutely confused as I did not have any sibling.
                            Suddenly I had a really frightening thought that creeped me out for a minute. The
                            warm cup of coffee fell on the glossy wooden floor. I remembered the voice that struck
                            me last night. My eyes were almost popping out of my head as I got really petrified of
                            what I just heard standing still like a marble statue while the wintry wind though the
                            right window swayed those purple curtains and further my skin hair which stood up in
                            freak making me chillier than ever.</p>

                        <p class="about__text">The door creaked as I opened it to go outside. The kind of creak which a door makes
                            when it hasn’t been used frequently. As I stepped one foot outside the house, I looked
                            down on a sudden realization that this moment hadn’t taken place in forever, if not?!,
                            definitely felt like it. It had been 2 years already.
                            I kept another foot out and then another, I started walking. Still looking down like I
                            hadn’t felt this kind of feeling of walking on a road beneath my shoe soul in my whole
                            life, that’s what it literally felt like. Every step I took reminded me of how much I
                            missed here outside. I heard an unfamiliar voice, I turned right to see a swing swinging
                            on its own in the cold wind which further gently touched face and welcomed me
                            outside also making my scarf flow with it. This swing sound I hadn’t heard in months
                            but felt like decades and beyond.
                            I sat down on the chilly bench beside which was rather not visible seconds ago
                            because of the fog which covered everything like it was protecting it like a child in his
                            mother’s benign arms. As I sat down, I got lost in my quiet introspection. I wondered
                            “what was all of this?
                            “I changed my perspective a bit, though the quarantine was over, but most of the
                            learning is still on computer”. Maybe the virus led us to a new world of technology, it
                            showed us new possibilities, leading us to thoughts like “because of technology, this is
                            possible hence it’s better this way”. Some things of technology we had never explored,
                            we did, but now after exploration, we have a new path. Though the pandemic ended,
                            the mindsets of people are still alive. Probably everyone got so used to all this, in fact,
                            now they find it better, when everything can be done from home, school, official work,
                            mostly everything, the only difference now everyone is still at home but without an
                            invisible trap around their house which was earlier.
                            Why is no one except me outside their house, why just me? probably everyone forgot
                            what life was like earlier, way before. There is a good way of looking at it, now people
                            have more leisure time and better family spend, but I miss the life before. Can it come
                            back? Is this change good or bad? Till I get the answers to these questions, I will just
                            keep telling myself,“you may not always have a comfortable life and you will not
                            always be able to solve the world’s problems at once, but don’t underestimate the
                            importance you have because history has shown us that courage is contagious and
                            hope can take on a life of it’s own.
